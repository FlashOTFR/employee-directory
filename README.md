# employee-directory

This single page web app was built using react.  It's purpose is to display a list of employees that allows you to sort, or search for people.  As a manager, I want to be able to quickly scan through my employees, so that I can more expeditiously find information that I am looking for.

## Getting Started

When you load the web app, your list of employees will automatically populate.  After your list is brought up, you can search for specific people, by entering their name into the search field.  You will also be able to sort the columns, by clicking the table header for each specific column. 

### Installing

All dependencies are ready to be installed by the user, using npm i in your terminal.

## Deployment

This page is deployed on github pages at https://flashotfr.github.io/employee-directory/ .
